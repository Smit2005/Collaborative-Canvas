# 🧑‍🏫 Collaborative Canvas – Real-Time Multi-User Whiteboard with Smart Tools

A full-stack MERN-based real-time collaborative annotation platform where users can draw, annotate PDFs and PPTs, upload documents, and use AI-powered tools for question generation, PPT summarization, and web scraping — all in a shared session.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🖍️ Real-Time Annotation
- Collaborative whiteboard with multi-user support via `Socket.IO`
- Draw with Pen, Highlighter, or Eraser tools
- Insert Text, Rectangles, and Lines
- Adjustable pen and eraser thickness
- Smooth and responsive canvas with scroll-aware annotations

### 📄 Document Upload & Annotation
- Upload and annotate over PDFs (page-aware, scroll-aligned)
- Upload and summarize `.pptx` files with slide-wise breakdown
- Infinite canvas extension for longer sessions
- Export annotated canvas as **PNG** or **PDF**

### ⚙️ Built-in Smart Tools (Collaborative)
Accessible via the **Toolbox Panel**, all results are visible and editable by all users:
- **Question Generator**: Upload syllabus and PYQs (as PDFs) to generate questions using NLP
- **PPT Summarizer**: Upload `.pptx` files and get slide-wise summarized output with images
- **Web Scraper**: Input a URL to extract cleaned textual content using `newspaper3k` & `BeautifulSoup`

### 🔐 Authentication and Room Management
- JWT-based user authentication
- Create or join rooms via unique IDs
- Room owner exits trigger redirection for all users
- Local undo/redo/clear actions (not synced across users)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CollaborativeCanvas.git
cd CollaborativeCanvas
```

### 2. Install Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Install Backend

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
cd python-api
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure you are using **Python 64-bit** for packages like `transformers` and `torch`.

## 🔐 .env Configuration (Backend)

Create a `.env` file in `/backend`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

## 🧪 Key API Routes

| Route                         | Description                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `POST /api/tools/questions`  | Upload syllabus and pyqs PDFs     |
| `POST /api/tools/summarize`  | Upload PPT file                   |
| `POST /api/tools/scrape`     | Scrape content from a URL         |
| `POST /api/upload-pdf`       | Upload PDF for shared canvas use  |

---

## ✨ How It Works

- Users **create or join rooms** with authentication
- **Canvas syncs annotations** using `socket.emit`/`socket.on` events
- PDFs/PPTs are uploaded to **Cloudinary**, links are shared across users via socket
- **Python scripts are executed** through `child_process.execFile` in the backend
- Outputs are displayed in a **ToolboxPanel** and **emitted to all room participants**

---


## 📦 Deployment Tips

- Host the frontend on **Vercel** or **Netlify**
- Use **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku** for the backend (ensure Python environment compatibility)
- Store PDFs on **Cloudinary**
- If deploying Python API separately, set up a **FastAPI server** or containerize with Docker

## 📥 Save Canvas as PNG/PDF

Click the respective button in the toolbar to:
- **Save as PNG**: Captures current canvas view
- **Save as PDF**: Renders entire scrollable canvas area into PDF
